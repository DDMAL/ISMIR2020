# Update

The call for volunteers is **closed** now. 

Thank you to all of our 35 volunteers who offered their help during ISMIR 2020!

# Call for volunteers

For the next ISMIR conference, which will be hosted online, we are looking for **20 volunteers** from all around the world.

The volunteers will help to support the 24-hour schedule over the 6 days of the conference, from 10-16 October 2020. 

Each volunteer will cover **three 4-hour shifts**. 

If you are interested in volunteering for ISMIR 2020, please fill in this **form** (closed).
 
We will be accepting applications until 15 September 2020, however, we may close them sooner if we have enough people. Please apply soon if you are interested! 

In recognition of the time you will have to take out of the conference for volunteer duties, you will be given a code for **free registration** (or a refund if you have already registered). You will also have the opportunity to be **featured on our website** with a photo and short bio. 
 
Thank you for your contributions to ISMIR 2020 and for helping to keep the cost low for everyone!
