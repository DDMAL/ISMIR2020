# Performance Matters 
## Beyond the current conception of musical performance in MIR
----------
### Johanna Devaney, Brooklyn College

**Abstract**: This talk will reflect on what we can observe about musical performance in the audio signal and where MIR techniques have succeeded and failed in enhancing our understanding of musical performance. Since its foundation, ISMIR has showcased a range of approaches for studying musical performance. Some of these have been explicit approaches for studying expressive performance while others implicitly analyze performance with other aspects of the musical audio.  Building on my own work developing tools for analyzing musical performance, I will consider not only the assumptions that underlie the questions we ask about performance but what we learn and what we miss in our current approaches to summarizing performance-related information from audio signals.  I will also reflect on a number of related questions, including what do we gain by summarizing over large corpora versus close reading of a select number of recordings. What do we lose? What can we learn from generative techniques, such as those applied in style transfer? And finally, how can we integrate these disparate approaches in order to better understand the role of performance in our conception of musical style?

*Johanna Devaney's research seeks to understand how humans engage with music, primarily through performance, with a particular focus on the singing voice, and how computers can be used to model and augment our understanding of this engagement. Her work draws on the disciplines of music, psychology, and computer science and has been published in the Journal of New Music Research, Psychomusicology, the Journal of Interdisciplinary Music Studies, and Ex Tempore as well as presented at numerous international and national conferences. She is currently the speciality chief editor for the Digital Musicology section of Frontiers in Digital Humanities.*
