Johanna Devaney's research seeks to understand how humans engage with music, primarily through performance, with a particular focus on the singing voice, and how computers can be used to model and augment our understanding of this engagement. Her work draws on the disciplines of music, psychology, and computer science and has been published in the Journal of New Music Research, Psychomusicology, the Journal of Interdisciplinary Music Studies, and Ex Tempore as well as presented at numerous international and national conferences. She is currently the speciality chief editor for the Digital Musicology section of Frontiers in Digital Humanities.
