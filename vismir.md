The conference will occur October 11â€“15 with 24 hr programming to facilitate accessibility and visibility across time zones, and in a virtual environment supporting the peer-to-peer discussions that ISMIR has long prioritized. The ISMIR 2020 team looks forward to welcoming our research community to a new conference experience.

More details to come.
