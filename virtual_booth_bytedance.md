# Speech, Audio & Music Intelligence Research

---

Welcome to ByteDance booth! We're SAMI (Speech, Audio & Music Intelligence) team at ByteDance AI Research lab. Over last 2+ years, we've been working on many exciting research projects from our London, California, and Beijing/Shanghai offices. The topics include MIR, intelligent music creation and production, speech analysis and synthesis, multi-modal understanding, audio understanding, and so on.
