# ISMIR2020 Code of Conduct

ISMIR2020 is committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. All attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

## The Quick Version

Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone. Participants are expected to engage in constructive, respectful, and inclusive conversations, and harassment of conference participants in any form will not be tolerated. Participants are expected to respect the privacy protocols of the conference. This Code of Conduct applies to all ISMIR2020 activities including talks, poster sessions, tutorials, workshops, social events, Twitter, and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

## The Less Quick Version

## Harassment

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, posting of inappropriate sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, and unwelcome sexual attention. Other forms of harassment for the virtual format of ISMIR2020 include disrupting the virtual meeting (e.g., &quot;zoom-bombing&quot;), engaging in harm or threats of harm of any kind, and creating/contributing to a safety threat or unsafe or exclusionary situation.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsors should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

## Privacy Protocols: Screencaptures, Audio and Video recordings

Some scheduled ISMIR events will be recorded and streamed. Participants will be alerted in the program and at events.

Do not take audio or video recordings of any ISMIR 2020 activities unless explicit permission has been granted by all participants.

Do not take or share screenshots of participants or presenters without explicit permission from everyone present or making sure that participants cannot be identified.

Do not share audio or video recordings of ISMIR 2020 besides those released by the conference (via social media or any other means) unless these have been posted with permission by all participants.

Do not take or distribute pictures of or copy research posters/presentation materials. All ISMIR presentation videos, posters, and papers are freely available on the conference site.

Chat logs can be saved for personal use only.

## Consequences/Enforcement

If a participant engages in harassing or inappropriate behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference platforms with no refund.

Participants asked to stop any harassing or inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.

## Scope
