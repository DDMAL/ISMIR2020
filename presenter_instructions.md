## Prerecorded Video
Similar to the 4 minute presentations of past ISMIRs, these prerecorded short videos should introduce the topic of your paper, inform of some insights from the work, and entice watchers to read the paper and visit your poster sessions. 

Video must be submitted by September 14th. Our team will be reviewing them for quality and appending title cards with schedule details before posting online. 

We recommend recording voice overs to a slide show or slides with embedded video of the presenter. One way to do this is record the presentation on a virtual meeting platform such as [Zoom](https://ieeetv.ieee.org/mobile/video/recording-your-presentation-with-zoom), [Google Meet](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9308681?hl=en), [Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/record-a-meeting-in-teams-34dfbe7f-b07d-4a27-b4c6-de62f1348c24?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us). Presentation programs such as [Powerpoint](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0b9502c6-5f6c-40ae-b1e7-e47d8741161c?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) and screen capture programs such as Screencastomatic can be used to record slide presentations with voiceover. 

Video presentations must include accurate captions, including [SOUND EFFECTS] and speaker name if multiple speakers are featured. Free web services such as YouTube Studios ([instructions](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796?hl=en)), [Zubtitle](https://zubtitle.com/how-to-automatically-add-open-captions-to-video/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw7ZL6BRCmARIsAH6XFDKU54H8xbNSiYXiY6Jsarj-54XzGIb5gJTVhxFHn87YLuk6i2pbtSUaAg60EALw_wcB), and [Amara](https://amara.org/en/subtitling-platform/) can be used to generate and edit captions in common formats. If captioning services are not available to you, you must submit a complete transcript text file (.txt) of the video with time stamps.

These videos will be publicly available for streaming during the conference on multiple platforms for international accessibility, and archived publicly for access after the conference as well. Note that excerpts of copyrighted audio recordings may cause a video to be suppressed on some platforms ([Archive.org](http://archive.org/), YouTube).

## Poster file
The digital poster file should be formatted for display on screens rather than large format print. We recommend a horizontal or vertical arrangement that allows participants to scroll and zoom easily. 

- Horizontal dimension: The poster should be designed to follow the proportion of a computer screen (16: 9) and allow for good quality graphics when zooming on specific sections of the poster. The recommended size is 24 inches tall (60 cm) by 42 inches wide (105 cm). The file should be saved as a PDF and its size should not exceed 100MB. ([Sample horizontal instructions](https://www.iaps2020.com/presentation-guidelines))

- Vertical dimensions: Another option is to generate a long poster, scrolled in one direction without the need for zoom. This arrangement is more convenient for mobile devices and tablets. PDF or dynamic document generated on Visme or similar webapp ([Ex](https://my.visme.co/view/8r9e71qk-icis2020-poster-gazefollowing-movieversion)). ([Sample vertical long instructions](https://twitter.com/Krista_BH/status/1272502304764235777))

### Submission
Deadline: October 3rd, 2020, [Anywhere On Earth (AOE)](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe)
Direct upload instructions are forthcoming.

## Poster sessions
Each poster will be given a channel in the conference Slack workspace. This channel will be open for asynchronous text discussion of the project throughout the conference and for synchronous audio/video discussion during the poster sessions. To help visitors, presenters can prepare their channel by pinning their poster documents and link to their paper materials and video on the ISMIR 2020 website.

Each poster is scheduled to be presented in two 45 minute sessions scheduled 11-12 hours apart. This allows ISMIR participants from around the world to engage in synchronous discussion with each presenter. In each session, 8 to 12 poster channels will be active in parallel. Poster presenters will open a slack call in their poster channel and visitors can pop into the channel and join the call to talk face to face. Like any in-person poster session, these video calls can only support a limited number of participants at once (15). If a channel call is full, visitors will be encouraged to keep browsing and come back in a few minutes, or to leave text comments and questions to be answered later.
