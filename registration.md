### Registration Fees

Everyone who is attending should register, as this will provide access to our online platform. Presentations, papers, and abstracts will be available to all on the conference site, and the keynote will be streamed publicly. Participation in poster sessions, discussion, meetups, etc. will be limited to those registered on the conference platform.

Reduced registration fees are intended for independent students, people from low-GDP countries, and low-income attendees, who are paying out-of-pocket.

### Publication Fees (New)

To recover some costs from cancelling the physical component of ISMIR, we are charging a publication fee for each paper in addition to registration costs.

Multi-author papers: please choose one person per paper to pay the fee. It is not possible to pay for more than two papers using this form; please contact **[ismir2020-registration@ismir.net](mailto:ismir2020-registration@ismir.net)** if you need to and we will instruct you on how to proceed.

The Reduced publication fee is intended for independent students, those from low-GDP countries, and low-income authors, who are paying out-of-pocket. If you choose this option, the difference ($50 CAD) will be paid by a corporate sponsor, and your name and contact information will be given to that sponsor.

### Refund Policy

Cancellations made before 1 October 2020 will receive a full refund minus the administration fee ($20 CAD for the Standard fee and $5 CAD for the Reduced fee).

The publication fee is non-refundable.
