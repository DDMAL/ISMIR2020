[Originally, ISMIR 2020 was planned to be held at Montreal, Canada]({{ site.baseurl }}/Montreal/). Following COVID-19 recommendations, it transitioned into an online conference in July 2020.

The conference will occur October 11â€“15 with 24 hr programming to facilitate accessibility and visibility across time zones, and in a virtual environment supporting the peer-to-peer discussions that ISMIR has long prioritized. The ISMIR 2020 team looks forward to welcoming our research community to a new conference experience.

More details to come.
