## About

You're invited to participate in HAMR 2020! It will take place October 16--17, virtually, across the globe.

[HAMR (Hacking Audio and Music Research)](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/hamr/) is a series of hackathons that have often been scheduled as satellite events to [ISMIR](https://ismir.net/) and [NEMISIG](http://nemisig.org/). Participants are invited to propose and pursue any project that would fall under the ISMIR CfP, including but not limited to:

-   Music informatics
-   Audio, speech and music signal processing
-   Machine listening
-   Computer music
-   Computational auditory perception/cognition

HAMR is open to everyone. To participate, please sign up to the [MIR Community Slack workspace](https://launchpass.com/mircommunity) (link available at [http://ismir.net/]), and join the **hamr2020-announcement** channel. Then, join in on the brainstorming that will happen during ISMIR, and log in on October 16th to start hacking! Further details will be announced in the Slack.

#### What's a Hackathon?

[Hackathons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) are events where people gather to collaborate intensively on programming or design projects. A hackathon is a great chance to:

- jump-start a new project;
- get to know a new collaborator;
- work on something silly or daring;
- learn something!

The goal of HAMR\@vISMIR 2020 is to provide a (virtual) space for people from
various institutions, backgrounds, and experience levels to test out
novel ideas as opposed to finishing a polished project and paper.

#### HAMR 2020 will be right after ISMIR

In previous years, HAMR has taken place the weekend before ISMIR as a kind of warm-up.
But after ISMIR, aren't we all just overflowing with new ideas,
exhausted from the week but longing to try something bold and new?

This year, HAMR will happen *after* ISMIR, making it an excellent chance
to dive into a newly published dataset, test out a newly launched service,
or work through a Jupyter notebook tutorial.

#### HAMR 2020 will be asynchronous (sort-of)

HAMR will run virtually and has to accommodate an audience stretching from Auckland (GMT+12) to Alaska (GMT-8). This makes it tricky to co-ordinate kick-off (where projects are pitched to the audience) and closing (where groups present their work, and the audience votes on what they liked). Our proposed solution: don't!

Our plan is to run HAMR 2020 *asynchronously*, so that the main event will take place on October 16--17 in your local time. It will work like this:

- Thursday, October 15 (wherever you are): post your project ideas to the HAMR brainstorming board.
- **Friday, October 16**: in the morning, decide what project on the brainstorming board you're interested in, and join that project's Slack channel. Start hacking! You can video-chat with your colleagues using Slack too.
- **Saturday, October 17**: by midday, your group should start putting together a demo presentation, and you should upload it as a video Saturday afternoon.
- Sunday, October 18: by the time you wake up, all the videos will have been uploaded, and you can view them and vote for your favourite hacks.
- Monday, October 19: the results of the vote will be announced to the ISMIR list.

## Prizes

Participants will be encouraged to vote in the following categories:

-   **Best Code**
-   **Best Documentation**
-   **Best Hack/Research Direction**

The awards come with bragging rights. Will there be physical prizes? No.
